**With the fleeting years,
Wind comes and goes,
Light leaves and sets,
Happiness approaches with sorrow,
Tears dry with smiles.**



**流年似水，水伴飘零花自落；
浮生如梦，梦固辗转缘应同。**

Welcome everyone visiting here!

I am a student. I enter university in 2010-09.

You can visit this blog [www.fyears.org](http://www.fyears.org/) ,which means "[Fleeting Years](http://www.fyears.org/)" and/or “[流年](http://www.fyears.org/)”.

The blog tries to aim at **mathematics**, **literature** and **critical thinking**, while **science** and **technology** may be involved.

The website is best viewed in Chromium 5.0 in Ubuntu 10.04 or up. Though in fact, any visitors should get good experience while visiting the site. (If you are using IE6, you should give it up and try Firefox or Chromium!)

PS: you may be interested in [my daily life](http://life.fyears.org/) or [github projects](https://github.com/fyears).
