It's a vivid world, but also weird and complicated.
Sometimes, people get lost in this world,
 mad or numb, violent or timid.
No matter how,
there is still something pure for us to pursue
-- better life, dreams，happiness,
calture and science.
That’s it.
That’s why we keep living in the world.
That’s why our ancestor give us brains to think
and bodies to move.
That’s why we are called “human beings”.
Though the world is weird,
we have to get into it,
and create our own value.
