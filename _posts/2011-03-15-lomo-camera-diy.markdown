I booked a "toy" online days later, and it arrived today.
It's a box of all parts of a camera, or rather, a LOMO camera. What's a LOMO camera? "The most stupid, old fashioned, and original camera." I would say like this.
Most importantly and unusually, I have to assembly those parts, and my task is to get a camera in my hands finally.
DIY --Do It Yourself-- always brings us fun, doesn't it?

Here are some picture taken. Of course, they are taken from my mobile phone, not the one I was making :-) , to note down the process.

Inside the box.

I spent much time on the shutter, which is not complicate but designed cleverly.

More than a half is finished.

Final effect.

Though the manual is provided, it took me 4 hours to finish the task. And in the end, I was a little excited.

Well, I haven't tried it yet, because it uses films and I've not bought them. Maybe I will add further information days later.
