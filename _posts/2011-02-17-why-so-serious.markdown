> Why so serious?



The sentence is showed on my phone when it's powered on. It reminds me that it is unnecessary to be serious while facing difficulties.

When I get older, I become more and more serious on so many many things. I am impatient, serious, afraid of the bad result, if any, and the future, while waiting for the result, while be eager for the answer, while don't know what is waiting for me in the front.

Obviously I am not brave enough now.

In fact, why so serious? It does't quite matter even when I'm in the lowest point of my life: the hope disappears only if I have died. When i get lose, I can win next time. **And so many "important" things are proved unimportant later, if it's not the precious experiences which tell me not to be so serious.**

So, I should be braver from now on. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst. Don't be serious, and be confident of what I have done and what's waiting for me.
