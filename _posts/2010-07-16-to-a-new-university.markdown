This autumn, I will enter an university from high school, which ranks about 1500 in the world.

I will be major in Mathematics and Information, and maybe Theoretical Physics later.

Well, I must say that I am not QUITE satisfied with this choice. But the problem is, that I have no other suitable choice, because I didn't behave well in the University Entrance Exam.

To be honest, the university is good in my motherland (though not the best), so I will do my best to study, and I try to enter an even better university while applying for a master degree.

The future is in front of me. The best is yet to come.
