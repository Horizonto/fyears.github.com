Inspired by a [post](http://www.xjp.cc/2010-log/07/my-greatest.html) from [xjp.cc](http://xjp.cc).

It is an interesting phenomenon in Chinese websites that, many websites claim that they are the "largest" or the "greatest" in the world.

Here are some examples:


> Baidu Encyclopedia: the largest Chinese encyclopedia in the world
Interactive Encyclopedia: the largest Chinese encyclopedia website in the world
Alibaba: the largest wholesale procurement market in the world
SOHU: the largest portal in CN
56: the largest video sharing website in CN
OneHear: the largest online music website in CN
Baidu MP3: the largest Chinese MP3 Search Engine in the world
Baidu news: the largest Chinese news platform in the world
Dangdang.com: the largest Chinese online bookstore in the world
PPS: the largest IPTV service provider in the world
......


It is so unbelievable! But, is that true? Are they really the largest?!
