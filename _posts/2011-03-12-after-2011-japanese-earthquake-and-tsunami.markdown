**A massive 8.9 magnitude earthquake hit the Pacific Ocean nearby Northeastern Japan at around 2:46pm on March 11 (JST) causing damage with blackouts, fire and tsunami. Some [useful information](http://www.google.co.jp/intl/ja/crisisresponse/japanquake2011.html) is provided by Google Japan.**

Sad. So serious. As a Chinese, I still remember Wenchuan Earthquake, during the time cities were in ruins. But this one is unexpectedly even more serious and rarer. Even Japan, in which people are accustomed to and always get ready for earthquake, still suffer so much. Many people died. And scenes showed in videos from Japan about earthquake and tsunami are more horrible and more shocking. Hope most of them who affected or trapped survive in the end.

Not only am I talking about the earthquake, but I am also talking about people, majorly Chinese and Japanese. Some differences of the reactions between Chinese and Japanese after catastrophes are worthy of deep thinking.

**1. Japanese **try** to be cold, and in order.** Most of them maintain order. The society keep on running functionally. All telephone booths become free. Several shops provide free food and water. However, there is almost no abuse of public resources. (Sadly, the contrary doings were and are found during catastrophes in China. ) Though it's because the epicenter is in the sea, instead of on the land, we should study to stay cold anyway.


> Calm and perseverance while facing the enormous tragedy , are the most precious wealth of civilization.
---- a comment from a newspaper



**2. Help from the world is touching.** Red Cross, teams and donations around the world and so on are telling us the precious spirit of lending a helping hand.


> Life should be treated regardless of country in front of catastrophes.



**3. A "healthy" attitude is significant.** Some Chinese (not so many, but I do hear some people's sayings) think that Japanese "deserve" to it. Considering the history between China and Japan, it's no strange that they think in that way, and I'm not going to comment the history. However, I agree it an "unhealthy and abnormal" thought. During Wenchuan Earthquake and some catastrophes in China, Japan did send some teams to help China. 


> If Chinese want to "beat" Japanese, we should work harder more on economy and science.



**In the end, I wish everyone can enjoy a peaceful life. No more people died from catastrophes.**
