These days, I reread the book _Does God Play Dice?_.

The excellent [book](http://vip.book.sina.com.cn/book/index_37395.html) was written in Chinese on the internet, which even readers having just received junior-school education are able to fully understand. The author Capo made good use of his clear and elegent writing style to expose the epic golden age of the development in quantum mechanics to us.


Max Planck put forward Planck's law to explain the full spectrum of thermal radiation.
Albert Einstein explained the photoelectric effect. $E = h nu$
Niels Bohr proposed a new model of the atom which included quantized electron orbits.
Louis de Broglie put forward his theory of matter waves by stating that particles can exhibit wave characteristics and vice versa. $\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$
Werner Heisenberg and Max Boren and Pascual Jordan put forward the idea about matrix mechanics, the first explanation to quantum mechanics.
Erwin Schrödinger made up his Schrödinger wave equation, the second explanation to quantum mechanics.
Heisenberg clarified Heisenberg uncertainty principle. $ \sigma\_{x}\sigma\_{p} \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$
Wolfgang Pauli proposed the Pauli exclusion principle.
Paul Dirac produced a relativistic quantum theory of electromagnetism.

Just as the writer says, "There never has been such a theory that contributes to our development so much, while confusing us greatly."

As a matter of fact, relativity is considered the top of "classical physics", and quantum mechanics is regarded as the foundation of "modern physics". However, a great number of physicists desire to discover the universial theory, called theory of everything(TOE). In my point of view, I prefer to the Causal Dynamical Triangulations to Superstring. An [article](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-self-organizing-quantum-universe) in July 2008 Scientific American Magazine expressed the possibility of calculating the dimensions of our world. And I think that its mathematical meaning is clearer and easier-understanding (well, I'm not proffessional enough).

Newton's theory combines things on the earth and in the sky; relativity explains almost all macro circumstances; quantum mechanics almost conquers the micro area. Hopefully some revolution can bring us the ulimate secret of our world.

Maybe one day, our names will be carved on the memorial, for future people's praise.
