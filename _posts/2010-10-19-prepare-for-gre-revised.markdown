One of my friends would like to study abroad in physics. As what we have to admitted, America is a good place for further study.

However, the problem is, that we those aren't growing up in the English environment have to learn so many many new words! Crazily enough, that  <Red Bible> or  <Blue Bible> is the essential book if one would like to take the GRE test, in which so many hard words (to Chinese) are involved. We must recite 6000+ new words! Every night and daytime I have to listen and listen and read and read!

It's such a hard work that only after I am determine-settled that I can achieve the goal!
