The software is amazing.

Here is the steps to install it in ubuntu 10.04

(thanks to [http://students.wmi.amu.edu.pl/~s301428/blog/?p=25#more-25](http://students.wmi.amu.edu.pl/~s301428/blog/?p=25#more-25))

command:

``` bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential freeglut3-dev libpng-dev
wget -c http://www.math.cmu.edu/~fho/jenn/jenn3d.2008_03_13.tgz
tar -xzfÂ  jenn.2008_03_13.tgz
cd jenn3d
vim makefile
```

uncomment the line

```
COMPILE_TYPE = linux
```

command:

``` bash
:wq
vim definitions.h
```

add these at the beginning:

```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <algorithm>
```

command:

~~~ bash
:wq
make
./jenn
~~~

And then just have fun!

Here is another one in which you can play Go in projective 3-space,

It is quite difficult!
