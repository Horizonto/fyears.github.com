The software is amazing.

Here is the steps to install it in ubuntu 10.04

(thanks to [http://students.wmi.amu.edu.pl/~s301428/blog/?p=25#more-25](http://students.wmi.amu.edu.pl/~s301428/blog/?p=25#more-25))

command:

[sourcecode language="bash"]

sudo apt-get install build-essential freeglut3-dev libpng-dev

wget -c http://www.math.cmu.edu/~fho/jenn/jenn3d.2008_03_13.tgz

tar -xzfÂ  jenn.2008_03_13.tgz

cd jenn3d

vim makefile

[/sourcecode]

uncomment the line

[sourcecode language="text"]

COMPILE_TYPE = linux

[/sourcecode]

command:

[sourcecode language="bash"]

:wq

vim definitions.h

[/sourcecode]

add these at the beginning:

[sourcecode language="text"]

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <algorithm>

[/sourcecode]

command:

[sourcecode language="bash"]

:wq

And then just have fun!

Here is another one in which you can play Go in projective 3-space,
