**With the fleeting years,
Wind comes and goes,
Light leaves and sets,
Happiness approaches with sorrow,
Tears dry with smiles.**



**流年似水，水伴飘零花自落；
浮生如梦，梦固辗转缘应同。**

Welcome!

As you can see, here is my blog www.fyears.org ([With The Fleeting Years](http://www.fyears.org/)).

The blog mainly expresses the stories of my meaningful and fleeting years and life.

I will write almost all articles in English. However, sometimes I am unable to translate Chinese sentences into English for the special feelings of  language.

Hope make friends with all visitors!
