Critical thinking is the purposeful and reflective judgement about what to believe or what to do in response to observations, experience, verbal or written expressions, or arguments. Critical thinking involves determining the meaning and significance of what is observed or expressed, or, concerning a given inference or argument, determining whether there is adequate justification to accept the conclusion as true.

Needless to mention that our vivid life is full of various phenomenon, including good as well as bad things, advantages and cons. To make an efficient  correct judgment  is not an easy task. All three-part suggestions might lead us a wrong avenue, in which we can hardly be aware the core of the problems. What's more, observing a thing everyone thinks highly of or recommend, we simple people easily lose our way and just follow others, apparently ignoring our inside thoughts.

Gone with an old but helpful motto "Actions speak louder than words."  Though assumption is significant, nout until it' proved of no mistake is it TRULY right. Whoever is facing a confused situation or cross or assessments from other people, etc, may find it of assistance if he keeps the saying in mind. Combining  regorous reasoning and experiment is a good solution, with whitch the bright successful future is shaking hands towards us.
