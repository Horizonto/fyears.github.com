Last night, while in dream, I modified the poem written a few days ago.



The experiment is similar to [this](http://www.fyears.org/2010/03/15/creating-chinese-poem-or-couplet-in-dream-while-sleeping/).

Here is the best version of the [poem](http://www.fyears.org/2010/03/10/a-chinese-poem-by-me/) created a few days ago.

哀情总如是，岁月染相思。
为说新愁强赋词，断弦付谁知？
暮色暗寒雨，孤影无觅去。
前路各歧微人与，春日尽飞絮。
