Generally speaking, the life is gambling one after another.


What we are gambling on are not only whether go to left or right, but also our directions in our future. We have to take risks, on our youthhood and ages, on our happiness and tears. And, in fact, our competitor is the Destiny.
Except some who are fairly rich or poor, who are fairly strong or weak, most of other simple people have to, gamble, however unwilling they are, considering how fortunate or unlucky they are.
Gambling is a game with exact asymmetric information. Every piece of useful or useless or clear or vague information results in subtle consequence. I think he thinks I think......will do these or those. We can not help ourselves considering how others think about us. I am sure that psychologists will take interested in this phenomenon.

It seems that most of the gamblers have their briefs. Whatever the synonym is, I think "destiny" is the best description. As one of the gamblers, of course I believe in Destiny. But I do not think he will bless me, and my only wish is that he doesn't notice me. Well, I agree that without benefits he will not give me any benefits, and it is of more possibility that he plays jokes on me.
So, my way of life which should be calm and peaceful becomes full of difficulties. Sometimes Destiny jumps out with different faces:
"You should leave something valuable if you want to go on!"
"So...rry, but, but, I have no money at all."
"You can replace money with youthhood and hard works, the present and the future."
Any other choice? Besides me there's a dirty road, which means I would bear starvation, and I not dare to step to the road; above me there's some big birds, and Only after I gain enough power can I jump up to their back, and fly in the sky free, but I haven't gained enough power yet; near me there's a door to other country, but the key is sufficient money, and I haven't. Then, I have to choose to have short rests between gambling.

We came to the world without any thing. Mercy and cruel Time gave us some capital, those youthhood and ages, those thrilling and ambition, "Boys and girls, remember, the rule is to gamble, before you gain the power to change the rule. I wait for you at your end." After that we go forward with hopes. In the end, some gain a lot, and some even have changed the rule. However, more lose anything, and leave the world with nothing.

  广义地说，我们的每一场选择都是一场赌博。

  我们赌的，不仅是向左走，向右走，而是以我们未来一生的方向作赌，以我们的青春与岁月，欢笑和泪水作为赌注，以命运之神为对手下赌。
  除了某些出生很好或很坏的的人，除了某些实力很强与很差的人，中间的大部分芸芸众生都不得不下注，在不停的计算中庆幸或扼腕。
  赌博是一场博弈，流泪流血。一场信息极端不对称的博弈。每一个有用的无用的明晰的模糊的信息都会引起微妙的后果。我认为他们认为我认为......会怎样做，正如我们玩石头剪刀布免不得揣测对方心理，我们赌博时也免不得这种度量，心理学家必然对这种心理博弈很有兴趣。

  有个有趣的研究，大部分赌徒都有信仰。不论被信仰的超越世俗的力量的代名词是什么，“命运”是最合适的。作为赌徒之一，我自然也相信他的存在，但我不相信他会保佑我，只祈求他不要耍我。你说，没事没好处他为啥要保佑我呢，换了你也不干是吧，偶尔玩玩恶作剧的概率大了许多。
  于是，我与世无争本应平静的道路平生曲折风浪斜坡荆棘，时不时的命运以牛鬼蛇神的面貌跳出来：
  “此路是我......”
  “靠，我没钱！”
  “你可以贷款，你的青春与血汗，现在和未来。”
  我还有别的选择吗？旁边的肮脏小路，意味着食不果腹的日子，我不敢去；头上不时有飞鸟经过，有绝对实力如状元级别的话大可以跳上鸟背，天高任鸟飞，但我还没有这种能力；不远处有有着不同规则的外国的大门，但是要有足够的金钱作为钥匙，我没有钱......于是，我只能在人生的一场又一场赌博之间喘息。

  我们赤裸裸地来，仁慈又残酷的时间老人交给我们一些本钱，那些青春与岁月，那些激情与志气，“孩子，去赌吧，记住，这就是游戏规则。在你获得足够的力量改变规则之前都要赌。我在你的尽头等你。”于是我们满怀希望地上路。有人满载地去了尽头，有人甚至改变了规则，也有更多人血本无归，赤裸裸的去了。
