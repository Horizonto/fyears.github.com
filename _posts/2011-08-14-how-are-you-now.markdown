Today it occurs to me that I haven't seen you for such a long time.

How are you? What are you doing? What are you interested in now? How about your new friends and are they as reliable as your old friends? What's your hairstyle? What are you happy for or what is grieving you?......

All questions flood to me.

But I don't know. And I don't know how to get to know. You seldom update your QQ, RenRen, Blog, Microblog. I don't want to disturb you with strange text messages. No of my close friends knows much about you...... 

I am wondering, what will I say if we meet again?

"Hi. Long time no see. Bye."
