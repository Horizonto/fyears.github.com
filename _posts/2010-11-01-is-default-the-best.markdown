Once I can not decide which choice is the best while using some applications, I always leave it blank or the default value. "Hey, the author of the apps should have consider the best suitable value for us." Many people like me think like this.

However, sometimes it is NOT EXACTLY true.

For instance, I have installed Ubuntu for times.

Ubuntu aims to become the "Out-of-the-box" system. Yes, I can surf the Internet or start programming after installing it. But details are still the problem. To my annoyance, once I finish the installation, I ALWAYS have to configure the PinYin IME, because the developers of Ubuntu didn't select the best PinYin IME for we Chinese.

It is an easy example. But it still claims some points. Developers try to provide automatic tools for our convenient life, in which many default values are set. **But you can never satisfy everyone, so the default selections are not always the best.**

In my opinion, guidance provided gives the balanced choice. "Simple" and "Advance" settings give users a better concept about what and how to configure the values. And users should be told to change the settings bravely to acquire a best experience.

**Default doesn't means the best. It often just tell us what the most compatible solutions are.**
