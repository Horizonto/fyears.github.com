A peaceful revolution or bloodless coup is a regime change that occurs without violence. A Peaceful revolution is, if between two sides, one faction is not willing to use armed force. If the revolutionists refuse to use violence, it is known as a nonviolent revolution. If the revolutionists are willing to use force, but the loyalists (government) negotiate or surrender to divert armed conflict, a type of bloodless war. Hawaii has had both types of peaceful revolutions in 1893 and 1954, other peaceful revolutions that have occurred are the Bloodless Revolution of 1688 in England, the People Power Revolution of 1986 in the Philippines, and the peaceful revolution of 1989 in Germany.

内插入LaTeX代码是这样的：$\exp(-\frac{x^2}{2})$，试试看看吧
