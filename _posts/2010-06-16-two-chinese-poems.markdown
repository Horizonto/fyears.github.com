Here are the (almost) best [Chinese poems](http://www.fyears.org/2010/06/two-chinese-poems/) created by my friend and me before.

I review them today. Some special feelings flood into my mind. I always agree that poems and music can express people's deep feelings, no matter they're poets or musicians or not.

[With the fleeting years](http://www.fyears.org), my friends and I grow up. We are changing. However, some thing in our hearts never changes, never.




秋待
苔过青阶痕如霜，花恋寒枝落时长。
辘折秋菊伤成道，泪重薄尘秋彷徨。
败翳何拥靖阳昱，轻风无觅郭外藏。
霞红因醉夕无意，笑别山影东海茫。
谁伴枯藤墙前待，等尽黄昏残叶葬。




青玉案
夜惊雨淅衾难暖，窗花泛，房物乱，秋水弹花尘未散。
湖盈光淡，萧疏残影，别是怜枝残。
又忆佳人曾远笑，高望浅云黑更遥，低语喃声白发憔。
北风沉晓，月色瘦渺，湿枕入寒寥。
